Brand Story: 

Food is one of our earliest and most natural experiences of being human. Our tastes and palettes
may have changes vastly over time but it still remains primary to our existence.
From the town of San Marzano Sul Sarno, born in the volcanic soil of the destructive Mount
Vesuvius comes the San Marzano tomato. Central to creating Neapolitan gastronomy, nothing
embodies the spirit of food better than this tomato. It found life in the humbling shadow of a
mountain that saw the end of entire civilisations.
Depicting the plurality of nature, we pay homage to a tomato that isn’t just a spectacle of
nature but also a building block of Napoli cuisine. We endeavour to put on your table a piece of
life from the land of volcanoes. We are in feeling and spirit, Marzano’s
